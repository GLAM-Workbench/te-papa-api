Notebooks include:

* **Exploring the Te Papa collection API** — some preliminary poking around, focusing in particular on using facets and nested records
* **Mapping Te Papa's collections** — create some simple maps using the `production.spatial` facet of the Te Papa API to identify places where collection objects were created
